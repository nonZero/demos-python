Write a TCP server using twisted. It should listen on port 2345
and should implmenet the following protocol:

c- client
s- server

c:Hello (on error - close connection)
s:Hello
c:Auth,[username],[pass]
s: checks user,passed (if password!=user+user says bye and closes connection)
c:getStatus
s:sends internal status (add number of current connected users)
c:bye
s:closes connection

Extra credit:
	add client option to request the server to listen on a new port
	Example:
	c: startListening,3100,Hello
	From this point on server listens on port 3100 and says "Hello"
	on any input...
Extra extra credit:
	Client can send NEW CODE to be excuted on the server (a major
	security no no).
