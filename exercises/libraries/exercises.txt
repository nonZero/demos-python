Python Libraries - exercises

Chapters 1-2: Text Processing / XML
===================================
Ex 1
Fetch the feed of fresh Python packages from http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=rss
[Hint: urlib2.urlopen()]
Parse the <item> elements [for the exercise, use ElementTree or DOM, not dedicated RSS parsers].
Dump them into a CSV file with the following columns:
Date, Package, Version, Description
[Note: This feed has package and version together in the title field – you’ll have to separate them.]

Observe how the csv module used quotes around descriptions that contain commas.

Bonus Ex: cleanly separate parsing code from writing code.
Ex 2
Fetch http://ws.geonames.org/hierarchyJSON?geonameId=2657896
Parse this JSON and produce a nested XML showing the place of Zurich in the world:
<place name="Earth>
   …
      <place name="Zurich />
   …
</place>
Hint: special-case the first element, loop over the rest.

[Don't worry about the ugly "Kanton Z&#252;rich".
That's a bug of geonames.org – they should proper use Unicode in their JSON…]

Chapter 3: Databases
====================
Ex 3
Parse the CSV file you produced in Ex 1 populate an SQLite database with
Date, Package, Version columns.
To check that it worked, also do a SELECT and print the content of the database.

Chapter 4: GUI
==============
Ex 4
Write a simple “__ + __ = result” calculator.
It will have 2 Entry boxes and a Label showing the sum, which should update whenever ither of the entry boxes changes.

Bonus Ex: replace the fixed “+” with an Entry where you can type one of “+”, “-”, “/”, “*”.  Longer Bonus Ex: Use 4 radio buttons for this instead.
