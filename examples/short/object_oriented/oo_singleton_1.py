'''
This is an example of a singleton pattern in python.
Notice that since we cannot make the constructor private
we resort to making sure,inside the constructor code,
that we are not called a second time.

This example is not that pretty in that it does not use a
'real' static method of the A class to return the singleton
instance. See the next example for an improvement on this.

This 'getInstance' method is also not protected against multi
thread access. Again,see next examples for a more realistic
solution.

The problem with this example is that you can call the
constructor for A * without * the 'getInstance' method
(simply by a=A()) and in this case it will not be registered
as the instance (in A.instance). This can be fixed by moving
the registration into the constructor function itself.

class A:
	instance=None
	def __init__(self):
		if A.instance is not None:
			raise Exception('you called the constructor twice!!')
		else:
			# constructor code goes here
			print('in A constructor')
			self.my_attribute='value'

def getInstance():
	if A.instance is None:
		A.instance=A()
	return A.instance

myA1=getInstance()
myA2=getInstance()
if myA1 is myA2:
	print('yes,they are the same instance')
print(dir(myA1))
