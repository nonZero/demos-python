'''
Examples of constructors in python.
You must accept at least one argument in a constructor in order for it
to count as a constructor. You can also write a 'varargs' constructor.
Errors for not having the right method occur at runtime and not at
compile time. Because python does not have overloading then if you
do decide to write an __init__ method you have to write it well in
order to avoid a runtime error.

class A:
	def __init__():
		print('in A constructor')
class B:
	def __init__(self):
		print('in B constructor')
class C:
	def __init__(self,arg1,arg2):
		print('in C constructor')
class D:
	def __init__(self,* args):
		print('in C constructor')

try:
	a=A()
except TypeError:
	print('oh,no. Cant construct an object. Must pass self')
b=B()
c=C()
d=D()
