'''
This example shows that you cannot change the value of a local variable indirectly
using the locals() or the vars() dictionaries.
You CAN,however,change the global variables...

Things to notice:
- inside the function vars and locals look the same.
- inside the function globals show the REAL globals (without override of the locals).
- inside the function you are still in the __main__ scope (__name__=='__main__').
