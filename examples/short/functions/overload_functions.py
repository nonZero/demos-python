'''
This example shows that you cannot overload functions in python.
The second function 'overwrites' the first.

There is a kind of overloading in python using named arguments and
variable arguments but not of this kind.

Functions also share the same namespace with regular variables. So,
in this example,defining a variable named 'foo' would override the
function so that it cannot be used.

def foo():
	print('hello')

def foo(a):
	print('hello',a)

try:
	foo()
except TypeError:
	print('oops,got an error')
foo('mark')
