'''
An example exploring the many ways,right and wrong,to iterate
a dictionary in python.
'''

h={}
h['keyone']='valone'
h['keytwo']='valtwo'

# this is the most efficient method
# most common and very efficient way (does not guarantee order)...
for (k,v) in h.items():
	print('key is',k)
	print('val is',v)
# each time you get BOTH a key AND value as a tuple so you can use it as a tuple...
for x in h.items():
	print(x)
	print('key is',x[0])
	print('val is',x[1])
# this is the same but you only get a key each time
for x in h:
	print(x)
	print('key is',x)
	print('val is',h[x])
# this is less efficient (at least in some versions of python)
for x in h.keys():
	print(x)
	print('key is',x)
	print('val is',h[x])
# this is TERRIBLE performance wise although to a novice it looks
# almost the same... Some versions of python may be smart enough to optimize
# this away but you really shouldn't count on it.
list=h.keys()
for x in list:
	print(x)
	print('key is',x)
	print('val is',h[x])
