This example explores the None variable and NoneType in python.
'''

a=None

# lets output the type of None
# this type is special and is shared by no other type in the python type system.
print('type of None is',type(a))

# lets show that two nones are exactly the same
# they sort of 'point to' the same place as far as the python 'is' operator is concerned.
b=None
if a==b:
	print('yes,None==None')
if a is b:
	print('yes,None is None')

# lets show that None serves as 'False' as far as booleans are concerned.
if None:
	pass
else:
	print('yes,None is False as far as if statements are concerned')

# lets build a bool from None and see that it is false
b=bool(None)
print('bool(None) is',b)

# lets try to build an int from a None and see that we fail.
# This is good behaviour since it protects you from accidentaly
# interpreting Nones as integers. Imagine an array storing both where
# you do not pay attention to checking if the value is None before doing
# some arithmetic with it.
try:
	i=int(None)
except TypeError as e:
	print('yes,got exception from convering None to int',e)

# on the other hand,None is covertible to str (string). Watch out!
s=str(None)
print('str(None) has type',type(s),'and has value [{0}]'.format(s))

# lets show that None is not 0 or the empry string or False as far as actual value.
# We show this by storing all of them as keys in a dictionary.
# Notice that False and 0 do step one over the other (not nice!).
