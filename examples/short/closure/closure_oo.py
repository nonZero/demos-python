'''
This is an exapmle of how to use the closure feature to do some
oo work.
Notice:
- We treat the 'Person' function as a constructor.
- We call it with a capital first letter.
- We pass arguments to it needed to create the instance.
- In order to have lots of data in the closure we simply
store a flexible and big data structure in the closure (in this
case a dictionary).
- Because we want to return many methods and dont want tuples with
dozens of elements we return all method pointers in a dictionary as
well.
B This allows the user to call our methods by name instead of by
position in some returned tuple.
