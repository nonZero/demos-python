'''
This is an example of how to create a closure which is 'fat': meaning
has lots of data and not just primitives. In this case the closure
contains the list 'l' which can be very long indeed.

def create_func(l):
	def inner_func(x):
		l.append(x)
		print(sum(l))
	return inner_func

inner=create_func([1,2,3])

inner(5)
