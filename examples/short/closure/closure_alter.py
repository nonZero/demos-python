'''
This is an example that shows that we can change the closure if
it made up of non primitive data.

Here are the ways to do it:
- We may return a 'closure altering' function which then can be
used to change the closure.
- We may return a function that returns pointers to the data in
the closure. If these are data structures (lists,dictionaries
or sets) then they will be returned by reference and thus we
will be able to change them from the outside. If these are object
then they will also be returned by reference and again we could
alter them from the outside.
- A third way would be to use the __closure__ attribute and access
the data through that.
