#encoding: UTF-8

'''
This example shows that you can put characters in different languages directly in your code.
What you need to do is:
- use a unicode enabled editor that can save in an encoding different than ascii (vi can do that).
	encodings such as UTF-8 etc...
- write 'u' strings when you want then unicode.
- tell python about the encoding of your file (see the right after the shbang line).
