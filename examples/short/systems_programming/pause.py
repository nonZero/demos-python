This example demonstrates the use of signal.pause().
If you already know about UNIX signals then this is no great surprise.
For those of you who do not know about UNIX signals,pause allows you
to do a busy wait without a busy wait. Pause will put your process
to sleep until any signal arrives. Since number of signals is small
this means that your process will be asleep most of the time. This
pattern allow you to react to signals in your 'main' thread since
the signal handler can change some variable and cause your main
thread to react,just as in this example.

Another thing to note is that when the signal handler is running it is running
in the context of the main thead and the threading module reports it as such.
This is typical UNIX behaviour.
