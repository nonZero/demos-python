Write a module for dealing with dates.
It will have a mapping from month name to number of days in that month, and also from month number to month name.

The following functions should be defined:

get_num_of_days_in_month(month_name)
get_following_month(month_name)
is_leap_year(year)

Edit your date module:
1. Write a class that represents a Date.
It will be initialized from 3 numbers: day, month, year. The __init__ method will check the validity of the arguments.
Overload the operators: >, < , ==, !=, <=, >=.
	Write an __str__() method.

The data defined previously in the module will be used for validity checking of the dates.

Write a class Callender.
It will have the attribute events – a mapping from event name to date object.
Write the following methods:

Get_date(self, name)
add_event(self, name, date)
is_event(self,date)
get_all_events_in_month(self,month)

Write a script which creates a calendar from a file built as described below :
Event_name day.month.year
Event_name day.month.year
Event_name day.month.year

Hint: The module time can tell you what the current month is.

Add exceptions
==============
Go over the classes you wrote in the previous exercise.
Add exception handling everywhere it is needed. (Raise an exception for invalid arguments).
You might want to write your own exceptions for that.
The calendar creating script will handle the exceptions.
