Use closures to write object oriented code...
=============================================
Write an object called person.
The attributes for person are:
	age
	name
The constructor should receive initial name and age.
Write getters and setters to set name and age with
some validation (e.g. make sure that the age is > 0).

- add a print method for your object.

Show the use of your object.
Create two persons and show that they have different attributes.

Use only closures to implement your person objects.

Extra credit:
- make your object * look * like an object to the outside world.
