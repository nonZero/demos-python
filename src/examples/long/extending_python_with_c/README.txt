- you will need swig to run this example...
	(sudo apt-get install swig)

- this example shows two demos important for python and C programmer:
	Car: shows how to write an object in C++ and use it from python.
		this is a C++ example.
	atoi: shows how to wrap C apis that python may not give you access to.
		this is a C example (without code since atoi is in the standard C library).
