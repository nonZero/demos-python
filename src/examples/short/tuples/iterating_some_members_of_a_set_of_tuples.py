'''
Sometimes you want to iterate tuples and you dont want all members.
Here is how you do it

Notes:
- the underscore is actually a variable name so its use has no bearing on performance.
- the underscore is a convention only in python, not core language feature.
- you can even use the value of the underscore since it is a regular variable.
- it is however non-descriptive and on code review it will be evident that you are not interested
in that position within the tuple.

tuples = [
    (1, 2, 3),
        (4, 5, 6),
        (7, 8, 9),
        (10, 11, 12),
]

for (x, _, y) in tuples:
    print(x, y)
