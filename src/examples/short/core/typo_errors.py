'''
This is an example of what typo errors could cause in python.
This means that testing is more important in python than in
other languages. Note that the variable 'val_to_incremnt' is
local (in javascript this would be even worse since it would
be global).

def return_inc(val_to_increment):
    val_to_incremnt = val_to_increment + 1
    return val_to_increment

print(return_inc(5))
