- add example about making a manual page out of pydoc comments.
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7176560/generating-python-cli-man-page
	This is using sphinx which is already a dependency of this package.
- pass check_all and make it part of the build.
- print the number of examples and lines of code on the README.md
	file using templar.

- add a make check_code which runs the python compiler on all the scripts
	(but does not run them, just checks the syntax).
	how do I do that?!?
- demo the 'asyncio' module.
- do example of using the multithreading module.
- do an example of how to exit from a python script
	(quit(),exit(), os._exit() and all).
- do an oo demo of 'isinstance' and 'issubclass'
- show the problems of inheritance in python and why we need __
- show using the iterator interface directly.
- do an example that demonstrates the difference between inheriting
	from 'object' and not. See the 'type' example for a starting point for this one.
- do more realistic singleton examples. With multi-thread support,
	safe from direct construction and real static methods.
- do a singleton example by overloading the __new__ operator and always
	returning the same object.
- do a multi theading example that shows thread ids at the operating system level.
- do example about finally.
- do example about __future__ division and //.
- do example about cyclic dependency between modules.
- do example of iteritems in the dict example and more.
- show a demo of a profiler.
- show how to see garbage collector events.
- show examples about data strcutures from third parties.
- see that I have examples of the following:		
	- classmethod
	- property.
	- decorators.
	- locks.
	- system(3) wrappers.
	- fork and exec.
- do demo of dis.dis for disassembly.
- show examples of controlling recursion depth via sys.setrecusionlimit.
- do examples along the lines of
